# Airbnb Clone Backend: Features and Functionalities

## Overview
This document outlines the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend. These requirements serve as a blueprint for building a robust, secure, and scalable server-side application that powers user accounts, property listings, bookings, payments, and notifications.

---

## Core Functionalities

### 1. User Management
- **User Registration**: Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts using secure authentication methods like JWT.
- **Login & Authentication**: Support email/password login and optional OAuth login (Google, Facebook).
- **Profile Management**: Enable users to update profile info including photos, contact information, and preferences.

### 2. Property Listings Management
- **Add Listings**: Hosts can create property listings with details like title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
- **Edit/Delete Listings**: Hosts can update or remove their property listings as needed.

### 3. Search and Filtering
- Search properties by location, price range, number of guests, and amenities (Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly, etc.).
- Support pagination for efficient retrieval of large datasets.

### 4. Booking Management
- **Booking Creation**: Guests can book properties for specified dates, with validation to prevent double bookings.
- **Booking Cancellation**: Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings according to policy.
- **Booking Status Tracking**: Track booking statuses (pending, confirmed, canceled, completed).

### 5. Payment Integration
- Support secure payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal) for:
  - Guest upfront payments.
  - Automatic payouts to hosts.
- Support multiple currencies.

### 6. Reviews and Ratings
- Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- Hosts can respond to reviews.
- Reviews linked to specific bookings to prevent misuse.

### 7. Notifications System
- Email and in-app notifications for booking confirmations, cancellations, and payment updates.

### 8. Admin Dashboard
- Monitor and manage users, listings, bookings, and payments through a dedicated admin interface.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Management
- Use a relational database (PostgreSQL or MySQL).
- Required tables:
  - Users (guests and hosts)
  - Properties
  - Bookings
  - Reviews
  - Payments

### 2. API Development
- Use RESTful APIs with proper HTTP methods:
  - GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE
- Optional: Use GraphQL for complex queries.

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Guests, Hosts, and Admins.

### 4. File Storage
- Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary).

### 5. Third-Party Services
- Email notifications via services like SendGrid or Mailgun.

### 6. Error Handling and Logging
- Implement global error handling for all APIs.
- Log errors and important events for debugging and monitoring.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability
- Modular architecture to handle increasing traffic.
- Support horizontal scaling with load balancers.

### 2. Security
- Encrypt sensitive data (passwords, payment info).
- Use firewalls and rate limiting to prevent attacks.

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Use caching (Redis) for frequently accessed data.
- Optimize database queries for high performance.

### 4. Testing
- Unit and integration tests using frameworks like pytest.
- Automated API testing to ensure endpoints function correctly.
